RELEASE NOTES

A MATLAB toolbox for large-scale dynamical systems in state-space described by sparse matrices. It extends the capability of the Control System Toolbox by defining new Dynamic System Objects (sss) and analysis methods that exploit sparsity.

***
*Programmed with:* MATLAB R2015b

*Tested on:* MATLAB R2014b, R2015b, R2016b (both Windows 7 and Ubuntu 16.04.1 LTS)

*Some functions require:* Control System Toolbox

> Note: The Gitlab repositories hosting the sss project will become public soon, making it even easier for you to contribute to the sss project.
