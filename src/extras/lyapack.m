function lyapack
% LYAPACK - solve large scale problems, closely related to Lyapunov equations
%
% Description:
%       LYAPACK is a MATLAB toolbox (i.e., a set of MATLAB routines) for the 
%       solution of certain large scale problems in control theory, which are 
%       closely related to Lyapunov equations. It uses iterative algorithms and
%       is intended for large, sparse problems.
%
%       Amongst other things, it can solve Lyapunov and Riccati equations, and do
%       model reduction. Even though LYAPACK has been implemented in MATLAB 
%       rather than programming languages like FORTRAN, C, or JAVA, this does not
%       mean that LYAPACK is restricted to the solution of "toy problems". 
%       Several measures, such as the use of global variables for large data 
%       structures, have been taken to enhance the computational performance of 
%       LYAPACK routines. To put this into the right perspective, Lyapunov
%       equations of order larger than 12000 were solved by LYAPACK within few 
%       hours on a regular workstation. When using standard methods, 
%       supercomputers are needed to solve problems of this size.
